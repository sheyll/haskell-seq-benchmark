# haskell-seq-benchmark


A small project to play around with Haskell performance.

As the name suggests, the main idea is to benchmark 
`Data.Sequence` vs. `Data.List`.

The results are in [output.html](http://sheyl.github.com/haskell-seq-benchmark/output.html).

It seems that `Data.List` is the winner.

The code is in [src/Main.hs](src/Main.hs)
